RTM.EXE

STRINGS.TPU

which are part of the
Borland Pascal Version 7.0  Copyright (c) 1983,92 Borland International

These files are needed to compile the TPC16 compiler. Since Borland Pascal 7
is an old software and it is easy accessible over the internet I have decided
to include these files in the TPC16 package.
